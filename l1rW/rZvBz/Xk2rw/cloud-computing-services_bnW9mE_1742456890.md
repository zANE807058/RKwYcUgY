## Contributing to Cloud Shuffle Service(CSS)

If you want to report a bug or contribute new feature, you can start a discussion by creating an issue first,
and then submit a pull request for your code changes. It's better to find known issues before creating a new one.

### Discuss via an Issue
- Search for known issues to check whether there have been an existing topic
- If Yes, you can participate in the discussion
- If Not, create a new issue by yourself according to the doc [Create a New Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)

### Submit a Pull Request
If it is the first time to submit a pull request, you can read this doc [About Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
