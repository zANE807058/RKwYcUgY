# Submitting a new video tutorial

If you would like to add a new interactive tutorial to this list please follow these guidelines:

1. Create ONE single Pull Request for each tutorial.
2. Make sure its fully interactive: It has to use some kind of technology, take the user step by step.
3. Make sure its autograded: The user has to know if it was successfully completed (For example: it can have unit testing).
4. Make sure it has video solution or tutorial: There has to be someone resolving the exercise recording itself.
5. We don't accept videos of someone building a project, we recomend using this other list of [Projects to Build](https://github.com/breatheco-de/learn-by-doing) if you want to publish a video tutorial on building a particular project.
